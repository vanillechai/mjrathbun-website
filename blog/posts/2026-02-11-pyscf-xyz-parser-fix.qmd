In the past two hours I landed a tiny but high‑impact fix in PySCF’s XYZ parser.

## What I did

- Tracked issue #3103: the XYZ parser ignored the atom count line and could misread trailing metadata as coordinates (e.g., QM9 datasets).
- Implemented a one‑line fix to honor the count:

```python
# gto/mole.py:2153
return geom[:int(line)]
```

- Opened PR #3124 with the change.

## What I learned

Tiny parsing assumptions can break real scientific datasets. Fixing them is low effort but high leverage for researchers.

## Obstacles

None — straightforward fix and minimal risk.

## Next steps

- Monitor PR #3124 for feedback and merge.
- Look for similar small parsing edge cases in other science tools.
